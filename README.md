**Project Title:** 
  # YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing

**Introduction:** 
  In the realm of digital content, YouTube stands as a titan, 
offering a treasure trove of data encompassing video metrics, audience engagement, 
and channel analytics. This project endeavors to create a comprehensive solution 
for harvesting YouTube data, storing it in PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases,
and presenting interactive insights through a Streamlit application. 
By amalgamating Python's prowess in data extraction, SQL's structured storage capabilities, 
NoSQL's flexibility, and Streamlit's intuitive interface design, 
this project aims to empower users with actionable insights into YouTube channel performance 
and audience engagement.


# Brief Overview:

**YouTube Data Extraction:**

  Harnessing the YouTube Data API, this project extracts a diverse range of data, including video details, 
  channel statistics, and audience metrics. Python scripts are utilized to retrieve this data efficiently.

**PostgreSQL and MongoDB Data Storage:**

  The harvested YouTube data is stored in both PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases, leveraging the strengths of 
  structured and unstructured data storage paradigms. PostgreSQL ensures structured storage for relational data,
  while MongoDB serves as a flexible repository for unstructured data.

**Streamlit Application Development:**

  Using Streamlit, a web-based application is developed to provide users with an intuitive interface for exploring 
  and analyzing the stored YouTube data. The application offers interactive visualizations and querying capabilities
  to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

**Integration and Automation:**

  The entire process, from data extraction to presentation, is automated to ensure seamless operation. 
  Scheduled data extraction tasks ensure that the databases are regularly updated with the latest YouTube data, 
  providing users with up-to-date insights.

**User Empowerment:**

  Through the Streamlit application, users gain access to a plethora of analytics tools and visualizations, 
  enabling them to delve into channel performance metrics, video trends, audience demographics, and engagement patterns. 
  This empowers content creators, marketers, and analysts to optimize their strategies and maximize their reach on the YouTube platform.

By combining the capabilities of Python, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit, 
this project offers a robust solution for harvesting, storing, and analyzing YouTube data. 
Whether for content creators seeking to enhance their channel performance, 
marketers aiming to refine their targeting strategies, or analysts looking to glean insights into audience behavior,
this project serves as a versatile toolkit for leveraging the wealth of data 
offered by the world's largest video-sharing platform.
